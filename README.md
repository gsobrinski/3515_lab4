## Description
This lab was a modification on Lab 3. Instead of displaying an ImageView and TextView on the same page like in lab 3, we instead launched a new Activity and
displayed the ImageView and TextView on that page. 

The second portion of this lab was creating a custom icon and generating an APK. To create a custom icon, I had to add a new Image Asset and then change the icon
in the AndroidManifest. To create an APK, I had to find where my keystore was and then use that path to create my APK. I also had to alter the password settings
in the build.gradle file.
